    <style>p {color: blueviolet; font-family: fantasy</style> <p>Minecraft   is a fun game where you can build many things like a apple like you can build litteraly anything. Minecraft is on many platforms like computers, consoles, mobiles, VR, Apple TV and much more. You can play with friends like I do. You can play on servers. All you have to do is put in the IP Adress of the server and boom you can play on that server. In the server's there are games. There is a game called survival games where its just like hunger games but in block form. There is a server where you can play a pokemon game which I am playing and suggest you to start playing. Never trust websites that say you can get minecraft. just go to www.minecraft.net.</p>
